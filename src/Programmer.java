//Create a Java class called Programmer
//The Programmer class will have the following instance variables:
//name as a string
//age as an integer
//wearsGlasses as a boolean
//The Programmer class will have the following methods:
//drinkCoffe() - that prints in console Espresso is the secret!
//printDetails() - that prints in console NameHere is a AgeHere-yo programmer
//hasGlasses - that prints in console Is NameHere wearing glasses? followed by the value of the dedicated variable
//create a Java tester class called TestProgrammers where you:
//create 2 Programmer objects (class instance)
//define the state of the objects by assigning values to the instance variables
//call the drinkCoffee() and printDetails() methods for the first Programmer object
//call the printDetails() and hasGlasses() methods for the second Programmer object
